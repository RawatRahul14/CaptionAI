# Image Captioning with Attention Mechanism

CaptionAI is a deep learning project that generates natural language captions for images. Using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with an Attention mechanism for sequence generation, this model aims to bridge the gap between computer vision and natural language processing.
